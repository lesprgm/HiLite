        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: June 18, 2025</p>
        <h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
        <p>HiLite is designed with your privacy as a top priority. We are committed to a strict no-data-collection policy for personal information.</p>
        <h2>How We Handle Your Data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> HiLite does not collect, store, or share any personal data that can identify you.</li>
          <li><strong>Notion Account Access:</strong> Your Notion account is accessed solely via OAuth. This means your data remains within your Notion workspace, and we do not log or share any user-identifiable information.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited Data Access:</strong> We only access the content you explicitly share with HiLite, and this access is exclusively for the purpose of sending your extracted PDF highlights to your Notion account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Usage Data and Cookies</h2>
        <p>While we don't collect personal data, like most websites, we do collect basic, non-identifiable Usage Data automatically. This may include information like your device's IP address, browser type, pages visited, and time spent on pages. This data helps us understand how our service is used and improve its functionality. We use essential Cookies for the proper functioning of the website (e.g., remembering login details if applicable, and cookie consent). These cookies do not store personal information.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not intended for anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us immediately so we can take steps to remove it.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
